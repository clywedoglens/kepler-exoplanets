# A Step Closer to a New Home

Our Flask project is an exploration into the [Kepler Exoplanet Search
Results](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results) dataset
and using machine learning to predict a confirmed exoplanet candidate. This
project was a part of the 2020 CUNY Tech Prep Data Science track.

Note: This Flask app is also hosted on
[Heroku](https://a-step-closer-to-a-new-home.herokuapp.com).
